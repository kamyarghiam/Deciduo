	return "Welcome to Deciduo! This program is a lifestyle app that helps you stay happy AND healthy by telling you when to stop eating/exercising. Simply follow the instructions on the screen to find the optimal amount of anything! The program does all the optimization in the back. The basic premise is so: people may feel temporarily happy by overeating, but they feel guilty later on. The same applies to exercise, in the sense that exercising too much does not make you happy or give you a large incentive to workout again. So, I created utility functions to maximize your happiness, given the constraints you give. What makes it unique is that the program adapts to you! The more you use it, the better it understand what makes you happy and how it should optimize your happiness. You can even see what your friends would prefer! Good luck!"
